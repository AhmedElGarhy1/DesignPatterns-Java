# Factory Method Design Pattern

## General UML
![Singleton Design Pattern](https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/diagrams/singleton/structure-en.png)

If we want to create one instance of a class and we `CAN't` create another instance of this class
Provide a global access point to that instance

### WARNING
This design pattern isn't recommended because if you want another instance in the future as the application grow you `Won't be able to`
